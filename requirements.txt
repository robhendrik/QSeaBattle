## Minimal, less-sensitive requirements for PyCatan
##
## This file intentionally avoids strict pinning of every transitive dependency.
## For reproducible environments, create and keep a separate lockfile or
## constraints file (for example, produced by `pip freeze` or `pip-compile`) and
## use it in CI or release artifacts only.

# Notes:
# - If you need exact versions for experiments, generate a dedicated lockfile
#   and don't commit long, fully-pinned lists into the main requirements file.
# - Keep large model/data artifacts out of the repo; use S3 or external storage.
